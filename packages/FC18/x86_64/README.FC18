Installation steps:

1. Flash a firmware with the hostapd-capwap package on a OpenWRT compatible router.
2. Setup a FC18 box where you want to run AC.
3. On the FC18 box:
	- Copy the RPMS and run: yum -y erase openssl-libs.i686; yum -y install openssl-libs.i686; rpm -ivh --force *.rpm
	- Edit /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
	- Run /etc/init.d/capwap-ac start
	- Run /etc/init.d/hostapd start
4. On the OpenWRT router :
	- Run killall -9 hostapd
	- Copy /tmp/run/hostapd-phy0.conf to /etc/capwap/hostapd.conf
	- Edit the driver in /etc/capwap/hostapd.conf line and set it to capwap_wtp
	- Run cd /etc/capwap; WTP; hostapd hostapd.conf
9. Enjoy the RX_MGMT events flowing trough the radiotap tunnel.

Logs:

- on WTP /var/log/wtp.log.txt
- on AC /var/log/ac.log.txt

Notes: 

- Always run AC first and WTP after otherwise they might get stuck in join state.
- When hostapd on AC is closed also the hostapd on WTP needs to be closed.
- When AC and WTP don't talk to eachother because they are stuck in join state
  allways kill hostapd, AC and WTP processes.
